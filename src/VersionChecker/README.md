# Version Checker

![mod icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ilan321/VSMods/master/src/VersionChecker/Checker/modicon.png)

Check this out on the [VS Mod DB](https://mods.vintagestory.at/versionchecker)!

This mod automatically checks the VS Mod DB for any updates for your enabled mods when you join a world. You can snooze this alert for a day (configurable).

Each line in the version check report includes a link to the mod page, as well as the option to update that mod from within the game.

If you have more than 1 out-of-date mod, there is an option to auto-update them all from within the game.
